    "### ‚úÖ Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kenya** reported the highest number of total COVID-19 cases among the three countries by the latest available data.\n",
    "2. **Uganda** showed a more stable trend in daily new cases compared to Kenya and Tanzania, with fewer sharp spikes.\n",
    "3. **Tanzania** had limited or inconsistent reporting, especially during the early phases of the pandemic, resulting in gaps in key indicators like daily cases and vaccinations.\n",
    "4. **Vaccination progress** was most significant in **Kenya**, followed by **Uganda**, while **Tanzania** had much lower reported vaccination rates.\n",
    "5. The **death rate** in all three countries remained relatively low, but this may reflect differences in testing, reporting standards, or healthcare access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Observations & Anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tanzania** paused COVID-19 reporting in 2020‚Äì2021, which explains visible gaps or flatlines in the data.\n",
    "- Sudden spikes in **Kenya's** new case counts suggest batch updates or possible underreporting during certain periods.\n",
    "- **Uganda** showed consistent improvements in vaccination rollout beginning in mid-2021.\n",
    "- All three countries had relatively low reported deaths per 100,000 people compared to global averages‚Äîpossibly due to younger population demographics or limited testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Recommendations for Further Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporate testing data (`total_tests`, `positive_rate`) to evaluate the true scale of underreporting.\n",
    "- Use `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred` for a more accurate vaccination coverage metric.\n",
    "- Compare mobility or lockdown stringency indices with case trends (available via Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker).\n",
